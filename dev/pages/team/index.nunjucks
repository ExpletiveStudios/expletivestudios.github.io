		<h2>Meet the Expletive team!</h2>
		<p>We're a little <b>!%£@?&amp;#</b> indie with big <b>!%£@?&amp;#</b> dreams. Founded around a kitchen table with a lot of coffee; we started out as a bunch of friends with an idea to make a game. A game that would be the spiritual successor of sorts to some of our favorites with tastely unique and memorable additions. Fast-forward six years of concepting and garnering experience, college and multiple jobs, all the while making consistent progress on the game.</p>
		<p>We are now working diligently to get our first game, <a class="link__alt" href="/games/eidetus">Eidetus</a>, into the hands of the masses for the first public alpha. Be sure to check back frequently for more updates.</p>
